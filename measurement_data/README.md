# Measurement data

This data was obtained from measurements using the script in the top level directory of this repository.
It was run against a rooted Samsung Galaxy S4, a rooted Samsung Galaxy S5 and a stock Samsung Galaxy S5.
All devices opened a tethering hotspot for the measurement device to connect to.

For each device, three measurements with 100 samples each were conducted.
The results can be found in the corresponding files:

- `s4_samples_rooted.txt` contains measurements against the rooted Samsung Galaxy S4
- `s5_samples_rooted.txt` contains measurements against the rooted Samsung Galaxy S5
- `s5_samples_stock.txt` contains measurements against the stock Samsung Galaxy S5
